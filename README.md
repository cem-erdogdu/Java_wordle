# Java_wordle
Me and my project teammate implemented a wordle game in java, which supports two different version. "Drag and drop" and "Default Wordle",
By creating a dictionary we were able to compare all 5 letter words with the 5 letter word which user entered.
This project presents a nice relationship between graphical components and data structures.
